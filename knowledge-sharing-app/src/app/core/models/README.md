# Knowledge Sharing App - Core Models Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the core data models implemented for the Angular Knowledge Sharing Application. The models are designed following TypeScript best practices with strong typing, clear interfaces, and proper separation of concerns.

## Model Architecture

- `AuthResponse`: JWT authentication response
- `PasswordResetRequest`: Password reset flow

**Key Features:**
- Role-based access control with three distinct levels
- Comprehensive user preferences for personalization
- Secure authentication flow with refresh tokens
- Profile management capabilities

### 2. Category Models (`category.model.ts`)

**Core Entities:**

- `ArticleStatus`: Workflow states (Draft, Review, Published, Archived)
- `Attachment`: File attachments with metadata
- `Comment`: Threaded commenting system

**Content Management:**
- Full article lifecycle from draft to published
- Rich text content with reading time estimation
- File attachment system with type detection
- Threaded commenting with internal/public visibility
- Article metrics and analytics tracking

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive content workflow
- Version-controlled content changes
- Rich metadata for search and discovery
- Permission-based access control
- Analytics and engagement tracking

### 4. Version Models (`version.model.ts`)

**Core Entities:**
- `Version`: Individual version snapshots
- `Change`: Granular change tracking
- `VersionComparison`: Side-by-side version comparison
- `VersionBranch`: Branching for complex workflows

**Key Features:**
- Complete version history with change tracking
- Granular diff tracking at field level
- Version comparison and restoration
- Branch support for complex editorial workflows
- Automated change detection and categorization

### 5. Search Models (`search.model.ts`)

**Core Entities:**
- `SearchQuery`: Comprehensive search request
- `SearchResult`: Rich search response with facets
- `SearchFilters`: Advanced filtering capabilities
- `SavedSearch`: User-defined search preferences
- `AutocompleteResult`: Real-time search suggestions

**Key Features:**
- Full-text search with highlighting
- Advanced filtering and faceting
- Search analytics and behavior tracking
- Saved searches for recurring queries
- Autocomplete with multiple data sources

### 6. Common Models (`common.model.ts`)

**Utility Models:**
- `ApiResponse<T>`: Standardized API response wrapper
- `PaginationMeta`: Consistent pagination information
- `ValidationError`: Structured error handling
- `AuditLog`: System activity tracking
- `Notification`: User notification system

## Model Relationships

### Entity Relationship Diagram (Conceptual)

```
User ───┬─── KnowledgeArticle (author)
        ├─── Category (creator)
        ├─── Version (author)
        ├─── Comment (author)
        └─── Permission (grantee)

Category ───┬─── KnowledgeArticle (categorization)
            ├─── Category (parent/child hierarchy)
            └─── Permission (access control)

KnowledgeArticle ───┬─── Version (history)
                    ├─── Comment (discussions)
                    ├─── Attachment (files)
                    ├─── Tag (labeling)
                    └─── User (contributors)

Version ───── Change (detailed modifications)

SearchQuery ───── SearchResult (responses)
```

## Design Patterns and Best Practices

### 1. Interface Segregation
- Separate interfaces for create, update, and read operations
- Request/Response DTOs distinct from domain entities
- Optional properties clearly marked

### 2. Type Safety
- Comprehensive enum usage for controlled vocabularies
- Union types for flexible but controlled options
- Generic interfaces for reusable patterns

### 3. Extensibility
- Base entity pattern for common fields
- Metadata fields for future expansion
- Plugin-friendly architecture

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading support through optional relationships
- Pagination built into core models
- Efficient filtering and sorting options

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Article
```typescript
const createRequest: CreateArticleRequest = {
  title: "Angular Best Practices",
  content: "...",
  type: ArticleType.BEST_PRACTICE,
  categoryId: "frontend-dev",
  tagIds: ["angular", "typescript"],
  status: ArticleStatus.DRAFT
};
```

### Advanced Search Query
```typescript
const searchQuery: SearchQuery = {
  term: "Angular components",
  scope: SearchScope.ALL,
  filters: {
    categories: ["frontend"],
    types: [ArticleType.TUTORIAL, ArticleType.DOCUMENTATION],
    dateFrom: new Date('2024-01-01')
  },
  sortBy: SortOption.RELEVANCE,
  sortOrder: SortOrder.DESC,
  page: 1,
  limit: 20
};
```

### Version Comparison
```typescript
const comparison: VersionComparison = {
  fromVersion: version1,
  toVersion: version2,
  differences: [
    {
      type: 'modification',
      scope: ChangeScope.CONTENT,
      content: 'Updated section content',
      lineNumber: 15
    }
  ],
  summary: {
    totalChanges: 5,
    additions: 2,
    deletions: 1,
    modifications: 2,
    wordsAdded: 150,
    wordsRemoved: 50
  }
};
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Multi-language content support
- Advanced collaboration features
- AI-powered content suggestions
- Enhanced analytics and reporting
- Content recommendation engine

### Extensibility Points
- Custom field support via metadata
- Plugin architecture for content types
- External integration hooks
- Custom validation rules
- Workflow customization

## Migration and Versioning

### Schema Evolution
- Models support optional fields for backwards compatibility
- Version numbers in API responses
- Deprecation warnings for outdated fields
- Migration utilities for data transformation

### Best Practices
- Always use the index.ts file for imports
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep interfaces focused and cohesive
- Document breaking changes thoroughly
- Provide migration guides for major updates

This model architecture provides a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable knowledge sharing platform while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
